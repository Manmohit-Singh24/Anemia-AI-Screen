# Anemia AI-Screen

**Anemia AI-Screen** is a demo web portal developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025** screening.  
It provides a **non-invasive anemia screening and management solution**, primarily aimed at **tribal pregnant women**, while enabling healthcare professionals to monitor and assist effectively.
